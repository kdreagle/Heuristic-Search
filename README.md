# Heuristic-Search

To Do:
- change closed list to binary heap
- Optimize algorithms (part c) (kinda unsure what exactly to optimize for this)
- Add 1 or 2 more heuristics (part d)
- Benchmark results (part e)
- part f
- implement sequential heuristic A\* and benchmark it (part g)
- part h and i

I'm going to write the code for benchmarking the the grids now
