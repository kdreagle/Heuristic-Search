# Heuristic-Search

To Do:
- Read the grids from the grids.txt file into the app
- Add functionality to the GUI to show values of f, g, and h on mouse click or mouse hover.
- Implement A\*
- Cleap up the code a bit (i.e. modularize the blocks of code and create a separate library class)
- Maybe change the data structure that holds the grid
